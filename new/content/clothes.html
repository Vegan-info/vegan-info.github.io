                        Fabrics for clothing</h2>
                    <p>The abuse that animals suffer at human hands is heartbreaking, sickening, and infuriating. It’s even more so when we realize that the everyday choices we make.</p>

                    <p>
                        Vegan Clothing, like vegan food, is any garment made without animal products. Some things may seem obvious (like leather and suede), but vegan materials also exclude any thing obtained through animal exploitation. We’ve seen a surge of high-performing vegan fabrics that are the perfect combination of soft and sustainable. Like other vegan fabrics, organic cotton is easier to clean than wool, faster drying, and softer to the touch.

                    <h2>The vegan clothing brands you need to know about </h2>
                        
                        <p>There was a time not so long ago when vegan wardrobes were full of plastic-heavy alternatives to leather and wool; it’s hard to find any material as durable and flexible as leather, and for a long time PVC was the best option of a pretty bad bunch. </p>
                        <p>Thankfully, vegan shoppers no longer need to choose between sustainability, quality, comfort, and animal rights; the growing demand for eco-friendly alternatives to animal products has triggered a lot of exciting innovation in the clothing industry. Vegan-inspired bio plastics are proliferating, with brands using everything from mango, corn, and cactus to create animal-free, low carbon alternatives to leather.</p>
                        <p>
                            These days even where brands aren’t 100% vegan, pressure from the vegan
                            movement has encouraged sustainable brands to be more rigorous in the sourcing of their animal-derived materials, highlighting sustainability issues beyond animal welfare, including the use of carcinogenic metals in leather-tanning, over-grazing, and deforestation. </p>
