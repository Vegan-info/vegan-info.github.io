                         <p>When identifying as an ethical vegan, whether you’re just an ethical vegan or vegan activist, you will often be subject to questioning by non-vegans. Such a situation offers the opportunity to represent veganism as a robust, logical position. In an effort to help ensure vegans have some of the most air-tight responses to common anti vegan arguments, I have decided to put together this book. This book is meant for new vegans, experienced vegans, and vegan activists who possess the goal of refining their ability to respond to anti vegan arguments. </p>

                        <p><b>The response to this argument is basic supply and demand.</b></p>
                        <p>When you purchase an animal product, such as meat, the meat is part of an already dead animal, yes, but purchasing that meat generates demand, which generates supply, and supply in this case is bred into existence animals that will suffer and be killed.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, purchasing animal products causes more animals to be bred into existence and killed. It isn’t as simple as, the animal is already dead. When you pay for animal products, your dollar is generating demand, which is generating supply, which is generating suffering.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p><b>Eating meat is natural is arguably the most common argument against veganism and is an appeal
                            to nature fallacy.</b></p>
                        <p>Claiming something is moral because it is natural implies that you think everything that is natural is good. Certain diseases, rape and killing are natural, but most of us don’t think these things are good. Therefore, trying to appeal to the fact that killing and eating animals is natural does not make much sense if you do not accept all natural things as good.</p>
                        <p>When it comes to the ‘canines’ argument, if a person accepts the premise that our canines are
                            naturally designed to bite through flesh, and this premise leads them to the conclusion that it is moral to kill for food, then it follows that slitting the throats of cats, humans and dogs is moral in virtue of our tooth structure. Imagine using the shape of your teeth as a justification for murder this is what meat-eaters who say this sound like.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p><b>This is just an appeal to tradition fallacy. </b></p>
                        <p>If you hold the position that something is good because it has been happening for a long time, this would imply that you think all other long-lasting acts are good, too. Rape and killing have been
                            happening for a long period of time. Imagine saying, “Rape and killing are justified because we’ve been raping and killing each other for thousands of years.” That would clearly be insane to the
                            average person with basic empathy.</p>

                        <p><b>Most people would never deem it moral to kill and eat humans, dogs, or cats,
                            “because they taste good”. </b></p>
                        <p> If the trait that justifies killing livestock for food is them being ‘tasty’, in order to be consistent, a person would have to accept it as moral to kill and eat dogs, cats, and humans so long as the killer finds them tasty. And to the reader, if your immediate response is to think, “But humans aren’t the same as non-human animals”, don’t worry, we’ll be covering that later.</p>

                        <p><b>This is more of an empirical argument, and the fact is that we do not need to eat animals to be healthy.</b></p>
                        <p>A properly planned vegan diet is suitable for all stages of life (Melina, 2016). There is nothing
                            essential for good health, which is exclusively found in animal products, which we cannot find in vegan products, and this applies to most, if not all people.</p>

                        <p><b>This actually is not true.</b></p>
                        <p>Most of the animals we consume are actually bred into existence. Therefore, our consumption of
                            animals, from a supply and demand perspective, generates the existence of more animals. The animals we are eating are not just found in the wild and killed; we create systems that artificially increase the populations.

                        <p>If the world went vegan overnight, but the fact is that the entire world will, most likely, never go vegan overnight. If the world ever fully embraces veganism,it would be a gradual process where demand for products requiring the breeding of animals would wither, and so too would the reproductive interference involved in such a practice. We can conclude from this that by the time we achieve a vegan world, we would not have nearly the same amount of animals on the planet as we do currently. Furthermore, we would be in an ethically vegan world, meaning there would be a massive number of animal sanctuaries compared to currently existing ones. If this were the case, we would have a heightened capacity to take care of the extra animals who wouldn’t face a death sentence.</p>
